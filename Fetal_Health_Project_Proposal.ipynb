    "Child and maternal mortality are considered huge threats to fetals and their mothers. Child mortality is the term used to describe the probability of a child to be dead between birth and five years of age. Moreover, the annual number opf female deaths from any cause related to pregnancy is refered to maternal mortality.\n",
    "It is important to note that there are more than 295000 deaths during pregnancy and childbirth as of 2017. The vast majority of these deaths, 94%, occured in settings eith low-resources while most of them could have been prevented.\n",
    "Cardiotography (CTG) is a graphic technique used for monitoring the fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions during pregnancy. This is done by using a machine called a cardiotocogram. Cardiotocograms are considered a simple and cost-efficient option used to assess the fetal's health, allowing healthcare professionals to take an action to prevent the child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n",
